# Cryptocurrency Price Trend Detection
- Developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) using tensorflow to
predict price trends on Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), with
trade signals averaging 7.1% profit.
- Generated a ~1GB SQLite database of ETH and BTC prices with
various timeframes using data extracted from Alpaca API.
- Created a backtesting algorithm and visualization code to
determine historical performance of trading signals generated by
the model.
- Hosted code (trading_bot_v1.py) on Heroku (cloud platform) that extracted price data
from API, analyzed data with the RNN to predict trend, created
smart contract calls to place trading orders on blockchain hosted
trading platform, and sent trading signals and order submission
details to a Telegram group.
- Two files are intentionally removed to protect intellectual property (indicators.py and orderbook.py)

The jupyter notebook Cryptocurrency_Price_Trend_Detection_Recurrent_Neural_Network.ipynb shows the creation and evaluation of the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network.

Note: Project outline links will only work if you download the notebook. They won't work in GitHub or Google Colab.
