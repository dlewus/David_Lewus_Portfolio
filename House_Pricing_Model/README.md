# House Pricing Model
- Tested multiple machine learning models (logistic regression,
gradient boosting regression, deep neural network) to predict
house sale price, with the most accurate model having a R^2
value of 0.9034.
- Utilized exploratory data analysis and visualization to evaluate the
quality of data used and observe trends.

This jupyter notebook looks at housing data from Kings County, Washington and uses several different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Gradeint Boosting, and Dense Neural Networks) to predict the price of a home based off a variety of features (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size). Additionally, an exploratory data analysis with several visualizations is presented.

Note: Project outline links will only work if you download the notebook. They won't work in GitHub or Google Colab.
