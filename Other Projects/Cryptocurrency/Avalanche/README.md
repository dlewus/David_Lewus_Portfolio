Projects in this folder are related to the AVAX C-Chain. So far there is only the Alpha Homora APY Scraper

## alpha_homora_apy_scraper.py
This file scrapes the current APYs from [Alpha Homora V2](https://homora-v2.alphaventuredao.io/) and updates an excel spreadsheet with these values. You'll need to have the metamask_config.json file in the same directory as the .py file. Make sure to fill out this config with your wallet secret phrase.
