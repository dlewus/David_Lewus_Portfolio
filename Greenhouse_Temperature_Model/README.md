# Greenhouse Temperature Model
- Used a LSTM recurrent neural network to predict the inside temperature of a greenhouse using the outside weather
- Cleaned and compiled greenhouse and weather data
- Utilized exploratory data analysis and visualization to evaluate the quality of data used and observe trends.


This jupyter notebook looks at environmental data from greenhouses at the Pennsylvania State University High Tunnel Research and Education Facility (Rock Springs, PA, USA). A LSTM recurrent neural network is utilized to predict the greenhouse internal temperature based off a variety of environmental parameters (i.e. outside temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity). Additionally, an exploratory data analysis with several visualizations is presented.

Note: Project outline links will only work if you download the notebook. They won't work in GitHub or Google Colab.
