# Machine Learning
These are machine learning models and data visualizations designed by me, mainly using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

## House_Pricing_Machine_Learning_Model.ipynb
This jupyter notebook looks at housing data from Kings County, Washington and uses several different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Gradeint Boosting, and Dense Neural Networks) to predict the price of a home based off a variety of features (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size). Additionally, an exploratory data analysis with several visualizations is presented.
